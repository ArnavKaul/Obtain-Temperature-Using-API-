# Obtain-Temperature-Using-API-
Hello viewers, this is my first official  project that I made using Python (along with Tkinter).
I have used the website -https://openweathermap.org/ to obtain the data(temperature) required.
If youre wondering how i got my API key, you can go to the website that i mentioned ,create an account and go to the API section to obtain the key.

For the time being i have created a simple interface to obtain  the temperature but you can do much more with it like finding out the humidity, feels like etc
along with adding a graphically appealing  interface.



Thanks for reading!
